              <h5 class="grayText termsDate">Last updated on November 1, 2017</h5>
              Virgil Security, Inc. (
              <b>Virgil</b>, or
              <b>we</b> and its derivatives), offers a suite of software components and associated services
              that let developers integrate powerful security tools such as password-free authentication,
              encryption of data in transit and at rest, and cryptographic verification of the authenticity
              and provenance of data, devices and identities across digital platforms into their software
              products. We also offer mobile applications and certain widgets that can be directly
              downloaded by end users for use on their computing devices. Our services rely on open-source
              cryptography libraries, plug-and-play APIs for almost every standard development language,
              and seamless key management to secure your digital world. In order to use our software,
              you have to agree to the following terms, which set forth the legal framework that makes
              it possible for us to provide our services. We are sorry they are so long.
              <br>
              <br> These Terms of Use govern our relationship with you when you use the Virgil Security website,
              <a href="https://virgilsecurity.com">www.virgilsecurity.com</a>
              </li>, our software, and services. By clicking on the I Accept button, completing the registration
              process, and/or browsing the site or downloading our software, you represent that (1) you
              understand and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, (2) you are of legal age to form
              a binding contract with Virgil (and have not been previously barred from using the site,
              services or software), and (3) you have the authority to enter into these Terms of Use
              personally or on behalf of the entity you have named as the user, and to bind that entity
              to these Terms of Use. You and its derivatives refer to the individual or entity identified
              as the user when you registered on the site. By using or accessing our site,  services,
              or software, you agree to the following terms and conditions. If you dont accept these
              Terms of Use, you can't use the site, services, or software.
              <br>
              <br> If you subscribe to the services for a defined period, then the Terms of Use will automatically
              renew for additional periods of the same duration, depending on and as indicated by the
              type of subscription you ordered, at our then-current fees for such services, unless you
              opt out of auto-renewal in accordance with Section 7.4 below.
              <br>
              <br> Section 10 of these Terms of Use requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis
              to resolve disputes, rather than a jury trial or class actions, and also limits the remedies
              available to you if there is a dispute arising out of the site, services, software, or
              these Terms of Use.
              <br>
              <br> Accessing our services from places where doing so is illegal is strictly prohibited. You
              must comply with all local rules, laws, and regulations regarding your use of our services.
              <br>
              <br> Your use of certain services may be subject to additional terms (
              <b>Supplemental Terms</b>) which will either be listed in these Terms of Use or be presented
              for acceptance when you sign up to use the supplemental service. If the Terms of Use are
              inconsistent with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will control with respect
              to such service. The Terms of Use and any applicable Supplemental Terms are, collectively,
              the
              <b>Terms.</b>
              <br>
              <br> We may change the Terms at any time. When we do so, we will make a new copy of the Terms
              of Use available at this page and within the software and any new Supplemental Terms will
              be made available from within, or through, the affected service on the site or within the
              software. We will also update the Last Updated date above. If we make any material changes,
              and you have an Account (as defined in Section 3.1 below) with us, we will also send an
              e-mail to you at the e-mail address currently associated with your Account. Any changes
              to the Terms will be effective immediately for new users and will be effective thirty (30)
              days after posting notice of such changes on the site for existing users.

                    unlawful), we may, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any Services
                    provided to you. All terminations for cause will be made in our sole discretion and
                    we will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account
                    for cause, except that, where we terminate the Services where required to do so by
                    law, we will refund any prepaid Subscription Fees for the remainder of the term then
                    in effect as of the date of termination.</li>

                    <b>Termination by You.</b> If you want to cancel a Services Subscription for one (1)
                    or more Developer Products, or terminate your Account entirely, you may do so by
                    going to the Change / Cancel Account page of your Account Settings page or by
                    contacting us via email at
                    <a href="mailto:billing@virgilsecurity.com">billing@virgilsecurity.com</a>. Unless otherwise instructed, cancellation of a Services
                    Subscription for one (1) or more of Developer Products will not affect any other
                    Services Subscriptions, and will not terminate your Account entirely.</li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Effect of Termination.</b> Termination or cancellation of any Services Subscription
                    for one (1) or more of Developer Product removes access to the applicable Service
                    from the Developer Product, but will not affect any other Services Subscription(s)
                    (if applicable) then in effect. Termination of your Account will remove access to
                    all Services, including those accessible to Trial Accounts, and we may also delete
                    your password, payment information and other personal information associated with
                    your Account. Upon termination of any Services Subscription, your access to the relevant
                    Services will terminate at the end of the then-current term (unless terminated by
                    us for cause, in which case access will terminate immediately) and we will cease
                    performing any functions related to the Services for your Account. We will have no
                    liability for the consequences of any suspension or termination of your Account pursuant
                    to these Terms, including for deletion of your content. All provisions of the Terms
                    which by their nature should survive termination of the Services, including ownership
                    provisions, indemnification obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of
                    liability, will do so.</li>

                  <li>
                    <b>No Subsequent Registration.</b> If we terminate your Account for your violation of
                    the Terms, you will not attempt to re-register with or access the Services through
                    creation of a new Account or otherwise. If you violate the immediately preceding
                    sentence, we may, in our sole discretion, immediately take any corrective actions
                    we deem appropriate without advance notice to you.</li>

                  <li>Any dispute that may not be brought in small claims court will be resolved by binding

                    will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. You are entitled
                    to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than
                    rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order
                    and are subject to very limited review by a court.

                    personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the Commonwealth of Virginia for
